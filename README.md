# C Project to calculate the lift of an aerofoil
This is a minimal example to calculate the coefficient of lift, and lift force generated by an aerofoil by running on the [Signaloid Cloud Developer Platform](https://signaloid.io/).

## Getting started

Use the "add to signaloid.io" image button to add this application to your
Signaloid Cloud account and run it.

You can fork this repository on GitHub, or clone it with:
```sh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:agnicol/Signaloid-Demo-Bernoulli.git
```
If you forgot to clone with --recursive and end up with empty submodule directories, you can remedy this with:
```sh
git submodule update --init
```

## Model Assumptions
The model makes a number of simplifying assumptions to aid calculation:
- The airfoil will operate in an altitude range of 0 to 10km.
- The airfoil will operate according to thin airfoil theory across angle of attack range of -5 to +10 degrees.
- The aifoil has a coefficient of lift at zero angle between 0.2 and 0.6, corresponding to a cambered airfoil.
- The linear slope of the lift coefficient to angle of attack is between 0.1 and 0.2.

## Build-time parameters
The only build-time settable value defined in [`src/config.mk`](./src/config.mk) is:

- `-DDEBUG` defines the `DEBUG` symbol, which disables Signaloid-specific statistical calculations, allowing the model to run in a "standard" C environemnt.

## Command-line arguments
The specific airspeed and wing area to calculate the lift for are set using the following command line options:
```
 [-s, --airspeed <Airspeed in meters per second (Default: 30.0)>]"
 [-u, --uncertainty <Percentage uncertainty in airspeed value (Default: 0.05, range: 0-1.0)>]"
 [-a, --area <Wing area in square meters (Default: 1.0)>]",
```
